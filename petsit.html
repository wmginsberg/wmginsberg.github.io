  <h1> Julian Care Sheet </h1>

  <h2> About Julian </h2>
  <p> I adopted Julian a few months ago from the East Bay Vivarium in Berkeley. His age is unclear, but he's estimated to be around 3 or 4 years old and considered an adult. He is a fairly picky eater and his favorite foods are blueberries, raspberries, arugula, and of course, worms.</p>
  <p> Julian's tank is on an automated heating and lighting system. There is a ceramic heat bulb in the top right corner of the tank, which is very hot. It heats the basking area to just over 100 degrees, making the resting area a cooler 85. The UVA/UVB lights automatically shut off in the evening and turn back on at night. Julian tends to fall asleep almost immediately after the lights go out, and wakes up when they turn back on.</p>   

  <h2> Contact Info </h2>
  <p> If you need anything, don't hesistate to text or call me at <span class="imp">516.503.4558</span> or email me at <span class="imp">wmginsberg@gmail.com</span>. I will be on Eastern time, which is 3 hours ahead of San Francisco. </p>

  <h2>Daily Care</h2>
  <h3> Cleaning and ðŸ’© </h3> 
  <ul>
  	<li> Spot clean the tank for ðŸ’©, pieces of food, or branch pieces that have fallen off. </li> 
  	<li> The best way to clean up ðŸ’© is to wipe it up with a dry paper towel, and then clean the remaining residue with Clorox disinfecting wipes. There is a scrub brush for instances where the ðŸ’© is really in the tile cracks.</li> 
  	<li> If ðŸ’© gets on any of the furniture, I sometimes remove the piece and wash it in the sink with the scrub brush if that seems easier </li>
  	<li> I clean the entire tank down 1-2 times a month, so no worries about doing that yourself </li>
  	<li> Note: I have organic cotton rubber gloves which you can use! </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Food &amp; Water </h3>
  <ul>
  	<li> Prepare a fresh salad from the fridge, with greens and two toppings. Add calcium vitamin powder. </li>
  	<li> Pour a fresh bowl of spring water from the dispenser on top of the tank.</li> 
  	<li> [every other day] Fill the small bowl with ~20 worms, coated in calcium vitamin powder.</li> 
  	<li> Note: I usually mist Julian with the small spray bottle before he is about to eat. He is supposed to be misted daily anyway, so I am trying to train him to correlate misting and food.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Socializing </h3>
  <p> Feel free to take Julian out of the tank and let him rest on your chest or sit on your shoulder. He enjoys being pet on his chin and he tends to stay pretty calm. This isn't required every day, if you don't want to, but every other day would be nice. He sometimes shows resistance to being taken out of the tank and being put back in, so you can just ignore him -- he can be dramamtic sometimes.</p>
