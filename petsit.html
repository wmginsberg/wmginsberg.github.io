  <h2> About Julian </h2>
  <p> I adopted Julian when he was already an adult. His current age is unclear, but he's estimated to be around 3 or 4 years old. He tends to have a small appetite, and doesn't always choose to eat every day.</p>

  <h2> The Tank </h2>
  <p> Julian's tank is on an automated heating and lighting system. There is a ceramic heat bulb in the top right corner of the tank, which is very hot. It heats the basking area to just over 100 degrees, making the resting area a cooler 85. The UVA/UVB lights automatically shut off in the evening and turn back on at night. Julian tends to fall asleep almost immediately after the lights go out, and wakes up when they turn back on.</p>   

  <h2>Daily Care</h2>
  <h3> Food &amp; Water </h3>
  <ul>
  	<li> Dump old bowls of food and water either in the disposal or in the trash. </li>
    <li> Prepare a fresh salad from the fridge, with greens and some other veggie toppings.</li>
    <li> You'll want to chop everything up into small pieces. Around 1cm for veggies and up to an inch for greens. </li>
  	<li> Pour a fresh bowl of spring water from the dispenser on top of the tank.</li> 
  </ul>
  <h3> Cleaning and ðŸ’© </h3> 
  <ul>
    <li> Spot clean the tank for ðŸ’©, pieces of food, or branch pieces that have fallen off. </li> 
    <li> The best way to clean up ðŸ’© is to wipe it up with a dry paper towel (if it's wet), or spray it with the small spray bottle solution (1/2 vinegar, 1/2 water). There is a <span class="imp">hand</span> scrub brush for instances where the ðŸ’© is really in the tile cracks. This is not the one on the long stick in the sink, that's for dishes.</li> 
    <li> If ðŸ’© gets on any of the furniture, I sometimes remove the piece and wash it in the sink with the scrub brush if that seems easier </li>
    <li> I clean the entire tank down 1-2 times a month, so no worries about doing that yourself </li>
    <li> Note: I have green organic cotton rubber gloves which you can use! They are in the drying rack by the sink.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Socializing </h3>
  <p> Feel free to take Julian out of the tank and let him rest on your chest or sit on your shoulder. He enjoys being pet on his chin and he tends to stay pretty calm. This isn't required every day, if you don't want to, but every other day would be nice. He sometimes shows resistance to being taken out of the tank and being put back in, so you can just ignore him -- he can be dramamtic sometimes.</p>
